        <p>The animals notice that the commandment about killing has changed to say, "No animal shall kill any other animal without cause."
            They finally finish rebuilding the windmill.
            Napoleon sells wood to Frederick, but later finds out Frederick paid with fake money. Frederick and his men then attack the farm and blow up the windmill with dynamite.
            After a fierce battle, the animals drive Frederick's men away, but many animals are hurt or killed. 
            The pigs begin to treat themselves with special luxuries. They change the commandment to say, "No animal shall drink alcohol to excess."

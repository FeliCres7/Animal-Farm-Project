        <p>Winter is a hard time. Snowball puts forward the idea of a windmill to provide electricity to heat their stalls and ease their workload. Napoleon disagrees and trains the sheep to bleat ‘4 legs good, 2 legs bad.’ 
            When he appears to be losing the argument, Napoleon calls up the 9 puppies he had taken away. They chase Snowball off the farm and Napoleon assumes complete control.
            Squealer convinces the animals that Snowball has always been a traitor.

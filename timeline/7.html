        <p>The animals work hard to build the windmill. His 2 slogans are introduced - ‘I will work harder’ and ‘Napoleon is always right.’
            Napoleon decides to start trading with the neighbouring farms, Foxwood and Pinchfield. He uses a middleman named Whymper to conduct business with them. When the animals see Napoleon ordering Whymper around, it makes them forget that they are not supposed to deal with humans.
            The pigs move into the farmhouse and start to sleep in beds. Commandment 4 has ‘with sheets’ added to it and Squealer convinces the animals that they must have forgotten that bit. 
            A violent storm destroys the windmill. Napoleon blames Snowball and tells the animals to rebuild it with stronger walls.

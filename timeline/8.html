        <p>The animals suffer through a tough winter without the windmill. 
            Napoleon forces the hens to give up their eggs to sell for money to buy food. 
            There are rumors of sabotage on the farm, and Napoleon and Squealer use these rumors to stay in control. To make this seem true, Napoleon sets up fake "confessions" and public executions. Many animals admit to crimes they didn’t commit and are killed by Napoleon’s dogs.
            Napoleon announces that the song "Beasts of England" is banned. The animals are losing hope, but they are too afraid to speak out. The original ideas of the rebellion are now completely ruined.

            The Seven Commandments are reduced to just one sentence: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."
            The pigs start walking on two legs, wearing clothes, and making friends with the humans they once hated. 
            The animals look through the farmhouse window and see the pigs and humans playing cards and laughing together. The pigs have become just like the humans, and the animals can no longer tell them apart.
            The story ends with the sad realization that the rebellion has completely failed. The pigs, who once promised a better life for all, have become just as bad as the human oppressors they replaced.

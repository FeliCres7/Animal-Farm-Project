        <p>Boxer, the strong workhorse, is injured in the battle but keeps working. His new sayings are, "I will work harder!" and "Napoleon is always right."
            The pigs and dogs still get more than the other animals. The pigs claim they need the extra food.
            Napoleon builds a school for the young piglets.
            Boxer collapses from working too hard. Napoleon says he will send him to a hospital, but instead, Boxer is sold to a knacker. The pigs use the money to buy more whiskey and have a party in Boxer's honor.

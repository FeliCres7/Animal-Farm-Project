        <h2>Fightings on the farm</h2>
        <p>Pigeons start to spread the word about the rebellion to other farms. They meet the owners of the two neighboring farms. Foxwood owned by Mr. Pilkington and Pinchfield owned by Mr. Frederick. They fear that rebellion will spread to their farms so they decided to join with Jones to mount an attack on Animal Farm to regain control.
            The animals unite to defeat them in the Battle of the Cowshed.

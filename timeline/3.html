        <p>One night Jones ,the farmer, got drunk and forgot to feed the animals. One cow broke into the store shed and
            all the animals started to help themselves. When Jones and 4 of his farmhands started whipping the animals
            to get them under control, they turned and butted and kicked, driving Jones off his farm. His wife packed
            her bags quickly and followed.
            The animals destroy everything that reminds them of human domination. They celebrate and the pigs, who have
            learned to read and write, paint the 7 commandments on the wall of the barn.
